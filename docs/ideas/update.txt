Here's a tailored plan to build a custom e-commerce site for Villainy Thrives using Laravel 12 as the base framework. This setup gives full control, integrates seamlessly with Printful for drop shipping, handles online billing via Stripe, and supports manual processing for direct orders (cash or e-transfers). Since you're familiar with Laravel, we'll keep it straightforward—starting from a fresh install and adding e-commerce features without overcomplicating with full CMS like WooCommerce. Total setup could take 1-2 weeks if you dedicate time daily, with ongoing costs mainly for hosting (~$5-10/month) and Stripe fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).
Step 1: Set Up Laravel 12 Base

Install Laravel via Composer: Run composer create-project laravel/laravel villainy-thrives in your terminal. This sets up the framework with PHP 8.2+ (ensure your server supports it; Laravel 12 is compatible up to PHP 8.5).
Configure environment: Update .env with your database details (use MariaDB or MySQL). Run php artisan migrate for initial tables.
Set up hosting: Deploy to a server like Laravel Forge, Vercel, or your existing host (e.g., from previous projects). Point villainythrives.com DNS to it.
Add authentication: Use Breeze or Jetstream for user login (e.g., composer require laravel/breeze --dev then php artisan breeze:install). This handles admin access for managing orders/products.

Step 2: Build E-Commerce Core

Install key packages:
Laravel Cashier for Stripe billing: composer require laravel/cashier. Configure in .env with your Stripe keys (get from stripe.com dashboard). This enables checkout sessions.
For cart functionality: Use a simple package like Laravel Shopping Cart (composer require hardevine/shoppingcart) or build your own with sessions.
Admin panel: Install Filament (composer require filament/filament:"^3.2" -W then php artisan filament:install --panels). It's lightweight and lets you manage products/orders via a dashboard.

Create models/migrations:
Products: php artisan make:model Product -m. Add fields like name, description, price, category_id, image_url.
Categories: php artisan make:model Category -m. Seed with your categories (T-Shirts, Hoodies, Embroidered Hoodies, Hats, Jackets).
Orders: php artisan make:model Order -m. Fields: user_id (nullable for guests), total, status (e.g., pending, paid, shipped), payment_method (stripe, cash, etransfer).
Run php artisan migrate and seed data.

Routes/Controllers/Views:
Web routes in routes/web.php: Define shop page (/shop), category views (e.g., /category/t-shirts), product details, cart, checkout.
Use Blade for frontend: Create a simple layout with Tailwind CSS (add via npm install tailwindcss and configure). Homepage: Hero with brand logo, featured products. Shop page: Grid of categories/products with filters.
Controller example for products: php artisan make:controller ProductController. Methods for index (list), show (details).


Step 3: Integrate Printful for Drop Shipping

Sign up/log in to Printful API (free).
Install Printful PHP SDK: composer require printful/printful-php-api.
Create a service class (e.g., app/Services/PrintfulService.php) to sync products: Use API to push designs, pull variants (sizes/colors), and automate fulfillment.
On order creation: If status is 'paid', webhook or queue job to submit to Printful (e.g., via Laravel queues: php artisan queue:work).
Handle inventory: Printful manages stock; sync prices/margins in your Product model.

Step 4: Handle Payments and Direct Orders

Stripe Integration:
In checkout controller: Use Cashier to create a session ($checkoutSession = $user->checkout([...])).
Webhook for confirmation: Set up in routes/web.php to update order status on payment success.
Guest checkout: Allow without login, store minimal info (email, address).

Direct Orders (Cash/E-Transfer):
Add a "Pay Later" option at checkout: Sets order status to 'pending' and emails instructions (e.g., "Send e-transfer to [email] or pay cash on pickup").
Admin dashboard (via Filament): View pending orders, manually mark as paid/shipped after receiving funds.
For in-person: Create a simple form/route for manual order entry (e.g., admin adds order with 'cash' method).

Taxes/Shipping: Use Laravel's built-in or a package like Laravel Tax for CAD taxes. Integrate Printful's shipping rates.

Step 5: Add Essentials and Custom Touches

SEO/Marketing: Install a package like Spatie Laravel Sitemap for auto-sitemaps. Add meta tags in Blade.
Images/Designs: Upload product mockups to storage (use php artisan storage:link). Ensure responsive design for mobile.
Security: Enable CSRF, validate inputs, use HTTPS.
Testing: Run unit tests (php artisan test), simulate orders (Stripe test mode, manual pending).
Custom Needs: Tailor to his brand—e.g., add a loyalty points system if needed (simple database table), or integrate with his music/community for cross-promo.

Once live, he can manage everything from the dashboard without lockouts. Costs: Free for Laravel/packages, Stripe as used, Printful per order. If you need code snippets (e.g., for Stripe webhook or Printful sync), share specifics like your current setup.
